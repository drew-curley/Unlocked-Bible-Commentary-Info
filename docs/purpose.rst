Purpose of the Unlocked Bible Commentary (UBC)
----------------------

The UBC is meant to provide in Christian-resource-deprived languages a two-volume Bible commentary (one volume per Testament), similar to the kind of commentary of the same scope used by Western Christians. The UBC will aim to present and explain the biblical themes present in the Scriptures in a way that allows the reader to understand them to a considerable degree. 

The UBC is meant to be freely translated and adapted into other languages: “open license,” “creative commons--share and share alike” Share Alike 4.0; see: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/
